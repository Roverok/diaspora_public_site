Hi Everyone, 

We know that if you’re not a contributor and don’t follow us on Github, it’s hard to see Diaspora grow and evolve. Now that Diaspora is moving into its second year and a new phase of development, here are some numbers on the progress we’ve made.

According to GitHub, we commit all hours of the day, but we do keep ourselves working our 9-7 most of the time.  We tend to commit mostly after lunch (om nom nom nom nom).

Our developer community is growing.  Diaspora has had over 100 unique code contributors and countless others have edited our wiki and updated Diaspora’s translations in over "51 languages":http://99translations.com/public_projects/show/181.   We have over 4,600 followers and over 840 forks, which means that tons of developers are checking out our code.  That makes us the "sixth most popular project on GitHub":https://github.com/popular/watched, right behind great open source projects like "JQuery":https://github.com/jquery/jquery, "Ruby On Rails":https://github.com/rails/rails, and "Node":https://github.com/joyent/node, just to name a few.

If you are a developer, you should fork or follow us on GitHub, and hang out in "#diaspora-dev":http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=diaspora-dev. *If you submit one or more "well formed pull request(s)":https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Git-Workflow, we will add you as a core commiter to the main repo.* If you haven’t looked at the code in awhile, now is the best time to jump back in. More developer documentation is coming soon.


We are going to keep everyone posted about the progress we are making over the next month. We have some really exciting things we can’t wait to announce.  Stay tuned!
